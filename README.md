# PyPass-Project
This code is a program written to encrypt and decrypt a given text using a user-specified encryption algorithm. Specifically, the program provides two encryption 
algorithms - Caesar encryption and base64 encryption - and allows the user to choose between encrypting or decrypting a text.

The Caesar encryption algorithm works by shifting each letter of the text by a specified number of positions in the alphabet, and the base64 encryption algorithm encodes
the text using a specific encoding scheme. The program also allows the user to save the encrypted text to a file and retrieve it later for decryption.

When the program is run, it prompts the user to select either encryption or decryption, and based on the user's input, it prompts them to enter the text to be
encrypted/decrypted, the shift amount for Caesar encryption/decryption, and the name of the file to save the encrypted text. If the user chooses decryption, the program 
prompts them to enter the name of the file containing the encrypted text and the shift amount for Caesar decryption. Finally, the program prints the decrypted text and 
waits for the user to close the console window.
